### Event Sharq

### Description:
Event Sharq is an event check-in MERN stack app built using React.js, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. The objective of the app is to allow users to check-in into events contactless. The idea of the app is to integrate a QR code which users can scan at select events. The app also features events (ex: sports, concerts), which allow them to browse through select events.

### MVP Goals:
- Allow users to register accounts and browse through events
- Allow users to save events to their event list
- Allow users to update and add additional information to their profiles
- Check-in with a unqiue QR code

### Post-MVP goals
- Allow users to purchase tickets
- Data/Statistics page
- Create food/merchandise page
- Estimation of wait times
